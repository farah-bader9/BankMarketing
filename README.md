Bank Marketing Project


This machine learning project applies various classification models on the Bank Marketing dataset from Kaggle.



Objective


The objective is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their profile and previous marketing interactions. The goal is to help the bank improve its marketing campaign effectiveness using data-driven insights.



Dataset Description


The dataset contains information on:

Customer age, job, marital status, education, etc.

Contact communication type and duration

Past marketing campaign performance

Output variable: deposit (yes/no)



Models Applied


The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Linear Regression (converted to classification)



Results


All models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-score using classification_report

Confusion Matrix was applied only for the Random Forest model

Bar plot comparison using seaborn to visualize model performance



Best Performing Model


The Random Forest model gave the highest accuracy of 0.83, making it the most effective for this task.
